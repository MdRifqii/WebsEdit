After 2000 years of death, it is rumored that the cruel demon king likes to make war and annihilate
anything that opposes him. But the demon king got tired of the endless wars and chose to be reincarnated. In the time of his reincarnation, a magic school is trying to find a candidate that fits the devil king's criteria. The demon king named Anos Voldigord finally enrolled in the magic school. Unfortunately, many people underestimate him, even though his strength is extraordinary.

Anos was surprised, in a world that was already peaceful it turns out that his magic power is weak, not as strong as 2000 years ago. Even though he is belittled, Anos is still respected by a girl named Misha, who is beautiful and friendly. The two become good friends on their way to a magical school called Delsgade
